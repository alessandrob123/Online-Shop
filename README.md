# Online-Shop
A fully functional online shop built with Express.js and SQL, designed to mimic a real-world e-commerce website. The project is supposed to include product listings, shopping cart functionality sign in and sign up as well as user authentication.

The core frontend is in place, the Express.js backend is operational, and registered users can successfully log in.

Next focus is to make registration page(for which backend is already finished) and an administration panel.
